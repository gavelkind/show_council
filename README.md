This mod for Crusader Kings II adds a "Show Council" button to the character interaction menu. It displays a ruler's five council members, along with commanders and some honorary title holders. For doges, it also shows the four vassal patricians.

This mod lets you quickly:

* Find out whether your rival has a loyal spymaster
* Check whether a vassal has a competent court chaplain
* Locate your enemy's commanders, and thus some of their armies
